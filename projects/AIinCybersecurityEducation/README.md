### ðŸ“š Exploring Lacunae in ChatGPT-Facilitated Cybersecurity Education: An Investigation into Knowledge Discrepancies and Learning Challenges


<p align="justify"> 
This study explored the use of AI-driven chatbots specifically ChatGPT in the context of cybersecurity education, with a focus on the highly specialized domain of threat hunting. Given the sensitive and technical nature of threat hunting, the study examined whether AI systems like ChatGPT could provide meaningful assistance in this field.</p>

<p align="justify"> 
To investigate this, an experiment was conducted with 35 students who had recently completed a cybersecurity course without the aid of ChatGPT. These students were then asked to evaluate ChatGPTâ€™s responses to 38 domain-specific questions, along with three additional reflective questions.
</p>

Key Findings:
- 57.8% of students believed that ChatGPTâ€™s responses aligned well with their existing knowledge.
- 20.6% reported gaining new insights through the interaction with ChatGPT.
- 12.1% found the responses inadequate, and
- 9.6% considered them irrelevant.

<p align="justify">When asked about the advantages and limitations of using ChatGPT, students highlighted its broad knowledge base as a key strength. However, they also noted its lack of access to real-time or sensitive data as a significant limitation.</p>

A particularly insightful aspect of the study examined whether access to ChatGPT might reduce the need to attend class. The student consensus was clear: attendance remained essential. They emphasized the importance of hands-on instruction for learning how to effectively use threat-hunting toolsâ€”skills that are best taught by experienced instructors. Furthermore, students recognized that the ability to craft precise queries for ChatGPT is a valuable skill in itself, one that also requires guided learning.
