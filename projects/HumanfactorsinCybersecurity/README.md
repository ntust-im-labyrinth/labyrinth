### üõ°Ô∏è Beyond Technical Training: A Cybersecurity Skills Framework for Non-Professionals

<p align="justify">
In today‚Äôs digital landscape, cybersecurity is no longer just the responsibility of IT departments or cybersecurity experts. Every employee plays a vital role in preventing cyber incidents. Yet, most existing cybersecurity frameworks and training programs are tailored for professionals, overlooking the broader workforce that often forms the first line of defense. Addressing this gap, researchers Lena Schramm, Raymund Lin, and Hsiao-Lan Wei have proposed a comprehensive framework‚Äîthe Cybersecurity Skills Assessment Framework (CSAF)‚Äîdesigned specifically for non-professionals.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  The CSAF was developed through qualitative interviews with 16 cybersecurity experts from Taiwan and Germany, capturing a global and cross-industry perspective. The study identifies two equally important dimensions of cybersecurity competence: hard (technical) skills and soft (human-centered) skills. The technical side of the framework aligns with the widely used NIST Cybersecurity Framework and includes five core competencies: the ability to identify potential threats, apply protective measures like secure passwords and updates, recognize risks such as phishing emails, respond effectively to incidents, and recover from attacks by actions like restoring backups or changing passwords. These hard skills are foundational and often the focus of corporate training simulations and IT awareness campaigns.

However, what truly sets this framework apart is its emphasis on soft skills, which are frequently overlooked in cybersecurity training. The authors identify six critical interpersonal competencies: communication and collaboration (to ensure transparent reporting and knowledge sharing), responsibility and accountability (owning one‚Äôs role in cyber defense), critical thinking (evaluating suspicious information logically), empathy (supporting colleagues in reporting errors without blame), adaptability (adjusting to new tools and evolving threats), and stress management and resilience (remaining calm and rational under pressure, especially during social engineering attacks).

<p align="justify">
The CSAF positions knowledge as the foundational layer, upon which both hard and soft skills are built. Together, these elements create a holistic picture of what it means to be a cyber-aware individual, even without deep technical expertise. The framework is not only a tool for assessing current skill levels but also a guide for developing targeted training and fostering a cybersecurity-aware culture throughout an organization.

<p align="justify">
This research is timely and essential. As cyber threats become more sophisticated, empowering every individual‚Äînot just IT experts with the ability to detect and respond to risks is crucial. Organizations can use the CSAF to design role-based training, conduct meaningful assessments, and ultimately strengthen their human firewall. The authors‚Äô work emphasizes that cybersecurity is not just about technology it‚Äôs about people. And by cultivating both technical competencies and human-centered soft skills, organizations can build true cyber resilience from the ground up.

For those looking to implement this framework in their training programs or security strategies, the CSAF offers a practical, research-backed roadmap.
