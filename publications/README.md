|   [Thelma: Threat Hunting Enhanced Language Models for Hunt Automation](https://doi.org/10.1109/CNS62487.2024.10735642)     | 2024    | 2024 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS) |<p align="justify">Threat hunting is a proactive security approach that seeks to identify and respond to cyber threats beyond traditional defenses. It‚Äôs related to digital forensics, focusing on collecting evidence of malicious activities. Despite various tools and methods available, threat hunting often demands skilled human intervention for complex threats. This paper introduces Thelma, an agent framework that enhances the threat-hunting process by employing large language models (LLMs). Thelma uses two LLMs: one for prioritizing threat hypotheses and another for generating specific threat-hunting queries. This approach streamlines the threat-hunting cycle, starting with hypothesis prioritization, followed by query generation and execution, which then informs the status update of the targeted environment. The cycle repeats until no threats remain. It is demonstrated that with minimal prompt-tuning and fine-tuning, the LLMs can reason about the environment and generate threat-hunting queries to be executed on diverse devices. </p>        |
|[Exploring Lacunae in ChatGPT-Facilitated Cybersecurity Education: An Investigation into Knowledge Discrepancies and Learning Challenges](https://iafor.org/archives/conference-programmes/ece/ece-programme-2024.pdf)|2024|The European Conference on Education 2024|<p align="justify"> This study investigates the possible use of AI-driven chatbots, such as ChatGPT, to assist in the process of cybersecurity education, particularly in the field of threat hunting. Given the course's sensitive and secure nature, it remains questionable if ChatGPT or similar systems would possess the capability to assist human hunters. An experiment was conducted with 35 students who had just finished the course independently, without utilizing ChatGPT. The participants were tasked with assessing the ability of ChatGPT to provide correct responses to crucial questions pertaining to the course and assist them in actual threat-hunting scenarios. The data was collected from 38 questions formulated for ChatGPT and 3 supplementary questions for students. The results show that 57.8% of students believed that ChatGPT's answers accurately represented their knowledge on the topic. Additionally, 20.6% of students discovered new information through ChatGPT's responses, while 12.1% found the answers to be insufficient and 9.6% considered them irrelevant. Regarding further inquiries, students have identified the primary advantage of using ChatGPT as comprehensive knowledge coverage, while the main disadvantage is its inability to disclose timely and sensitive information. The third supplementary inquiry evaluated whether students were still obligated to physically attend class if they had access to ChatGPT. They confirmed their attendance, acknowledging that they still needed to go to class as the lecturer taught them how to utilize various hunting tools to enhance their skills in threat hunting. They were also informed that they would learn how to effectively inquire using ChatGPT at a later time. |
|[Beyond Technical Training: A Cybersecurity Skills Framework for Non-Professionals](https://doi.org/10.1145/3716489.3728444)| 2025 | Computers and People Research Conference 2025| <p align="justify"> The human element plays a crucial role in combating cyberattacks. To strengthen cyber resilience, organizations must equip employees with the necessary skills to defend against these threats. As cyberattacks on organizations continue to rise, building a cyber-resilient society and empowering employees with essential competencies becomes increasingly important. While prior research primarily focuses on the skills of cybersecurity professionals, limited approaches comprehensively assess the skills needed by non-professionals. This paper presents a holistic framework that identifies both hard and soft skills essential for employees to safeguard their organization from cyber threats. Based on interviews with 16 cybersecurity experts, we categorize five areas of hard skills, aligned with NIST, and six critical soft skills: communication and collaboration, responsibility, critical thinking, empathy, adaptability, as well as stress management and resilience. A literature review and expert insights highlight commonly associated challenges. Our framework provides a foundation for developing improved cybersecurity skill assessments and more targeted training programs. It aims to facilitate discussions on the essential cybersecurity skills of non-professionals, such as employees or citizens, and to support organizations in strengthening their first line of defense against cyber threats.</p> |
